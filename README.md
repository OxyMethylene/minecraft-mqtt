# Mqtt plugin

A basic MQTT plugin for Spigot/Bukkit that will allow you to send MQTT messages 
from within Minecraft.

To use this plugin, compile it to a .jar file and put it in your Spigot/Bukkit 
plugins folder. Once there it should automatically load when you (re)start your 
Minecraft server.

For now this is just a skeleton plugin to test if this gets executed from Minecraft 
command blocks...

TODO :
- Connect to an MQTT broker
- Do the actual MQTT communication
- Set MQTT broker config in a config file
